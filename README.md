# Bankist App 

Note - This project is a part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course but I can also say I have also implemented so many features by myself without watching tutorials.

4 - user: as, password: 4444

There are a lot of comments in this project's code (script.js), as I wanted to record every little thing that I have learned throughout the project.
